MERRY CHRISTMAS, LOVE 💗
I just want to say thank you for being with me this year and for helping me get through everything. Thank you for all the love, effort, and little things you give me from simple treats like siomai to the things I use every day like shoes and more. I appreciate all of it more than you know. Thank you for always supporting me, especially during the times when I’m down, tired, or not okay. I love you always, Love, and I’m truly thankful that you came into my life. I’m also sorry for the times I hurt you, intentionally or not. I’m grateful that you still choose to understand me and stay with me. I really want us to be together next year, the years after that, and forever. What I love most is how happy and light everything feels when we’re together. Even when you’re tired from work, we still find time to bond, laugh, and do silly things that make us forget stress. Those moments mean so much to me. Thank you for being patient with me, especially when I’m moody or sensitive. The way you take care of me, even in the simplest ways, makes me feel so loved and safe. Thank you, Love, for always being my comfort and my safe place. Thank you for believing in me even when I feel weak or unsure of myself. You make everything feel lighter just by being there. I’m so grateful for all the memories we’ve made the laughs, the bonding, the quiet moments, and even the hard times that made us stronger. For the future, I want us to keep growing together, supporting each other’s dreams, and choosing each other every single day. I look forward to more adventures, more laughs, more bonding, and more moments where it’s just us against the world. I promise to keep trying to be better not just for myself, but for us and for our future together.
I’m thankful for you, always. I choose you today, next year, and in all the years to come. Merry Christmas, Love. I love you always 💕
